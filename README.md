Data Structures and Algorithms in C


# Overview
This repository is an attempt to understand datastructures and algorithms in C. It not only gives a different perspective to solving dsa problems but discusses alternattive approcahes to solving the same problem. The more faster, space efficient and also simple ways of solving complex looking algorithms.
